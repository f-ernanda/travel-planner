## üèÅ Getting started

### Prerequisites

Before setting up the project locally, ensure you have the following prerequisites ready:

1. **Node.js 20+**: Install Node.js version 20 or later. You can download and install Node.js from [here][node].

2. **MongoDB Database Tools**: Install MongoDB Database Tools to use the same mocked data without issues. Installation instructions can be found [here][mongotools].

3. **MongoDB Atlas Account**: Sign up for a MongoDB Atlas account to host the database. You can create an account [here][atlas].

If you plan to deploy it on the cloud, you'll need:

1. **Terraform**: Ensure you have Terraform installed on your machine. If not, you can download and install it from [here][terraformcli].

2. **Azure CLI**: Install the Azure CLI to interact with Azure services from the command line. Installation instructions can be found [here][azurecli].

3. **Docker Hub Account**: You'll need a Docker Hub account for containerization. Sign up for an account [here][hub].

4. **Azure Account**: You'll require an Azure account for provisioning resources. Sign up for free [here][azure].

5. **Extra**: You'll need to create and store the necessary secrets and environment variables on your GitHub and update the [GitHub workflow](./.github/workflows/main_sastravelplanner.yml) if necessary. For more information, see [this documentation][secrets].

Once you have all these pieces in place, you can proceed with setting up the project locally.
